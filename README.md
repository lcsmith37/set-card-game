# set-card-game
An implementation of the SET card game using Unity.

The zip file is an app that can be installed on an Android device. The game can also be played on a browser at https://play.unity.com/mg/other/set-card-game.

Includes a settings page where the timer can be turned on/off and a "Set?" button which either gives a hint if there is a set present or deals three more cards.
